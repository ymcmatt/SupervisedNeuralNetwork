# SupervisedNeuralNetwork
basic supervised neural network:


NeuralNetwork.ipynb

This nerual work can work on all data file with binary output 0/1.

It can achieve 1.0 accuracy on both linear and unlinear input. Both linear and unlinear sample input are provided.


Logistic_Regression.ipynb is a logestic regression model which can be derived to a nerual network model.
